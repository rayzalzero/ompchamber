/**
 * Deleting a session's side questions.
 *
 * A side question is keyed to the parent session but stored outside it — rows
 * in `btw_topics`/`btw_turns`, a live omp child per topic, and a private
 * transcript directory under `<db dir>/btw/<sessionId>/<topicId>/`. Deleting
 * the chat session therefore leaves all three behind unless they are purged
 * with it: orphan turns still readable in the database, and on disk a full
 * copy of the very transcript the user just deleted.
 *
 * Kept out of `service.server.ts` (which owns the interactive topic
 * operations) so that file's growth stays attributable.
