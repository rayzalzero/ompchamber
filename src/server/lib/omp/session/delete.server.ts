/**
 * Deleting a session: the transcript on disk, its subagent artifacts, and every
 * chamber-side row keyed to the session id.
 *
 * The transcript is authoritative — omp's own session listing is derived from
 * the JSONL alone — so a delete that removed only the chamber's rows would see
 * the session come straight back on the next sidebar scan. What "delete" means
 * here, in one place:
 *
 *   - the session JSONL, plus any `<name>.jsonl.bak-*` copy an earlier rewind
 *     left beside it (a full copy of the same transcript: leaving it behind
 *     would mean the conversation was not actually deleted);
 *   - its sibling artifacts directory, which holds the subagent transcripts;
 *   - the `archived_sessions`, `session_ui_state`, `session_stream_state`,
 *     `queued_messages` and `chat_sessions` rows for that id;
 *   - in mock mode the demo `sessions` row and its `files` tree.
 *
 * The caller owns the process: a live omp child MUST be destroyed before this
 * runs, because omp flushes its session state on shutdown and would otherwise
 * recreate the file this just removed. Side-question rows and workspaces are
 * the btw module's business (`purgeBtwForSession`).
