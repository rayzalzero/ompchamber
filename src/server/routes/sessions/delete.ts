/**
 * DELETE /api/sessions/:sessionId — remove a session and everything keyed to
 * it. The mirror of `archiveSession`: archive is reversible and keeps the
 * transcript, this one is the destructive path the user opts into from the
 * sidebar's trash button.
 *
 * Order matters and is enforced here, not by the callers:
 *  1. refuse a session whose omp child is mid-turn (a run, a live subagent, or
 *     a dialog the agent is blocked on) — the delete would kill work the user
 *     can still see, and omp would flush the file back on shutdown anyway;
 *  2. destroy the child and AWAIT its exit — omp writes session state on
 *     shutdown and would otherwise recreate the transcript just removed;
 *  3. purge side questions, then the transcript, artifacts and chamber rows.
 *
 * A pending `new-…` session is refused: it is a client-side placeholder with
 * nothing stored anywhere yet, so deleting it is the same as navigating away.
